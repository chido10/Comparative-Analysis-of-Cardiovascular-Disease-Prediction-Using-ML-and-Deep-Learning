# Comparative-Analysis-of-Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-Using-ML-and-Deep-Learning
This research investigates the potential of using physiological signs, including respiratory rate, blood pressure, body 
temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in humans. Machine learning (ML) and deep 
learning (DL) models were employed to determine the most effective prediction model by comparing their performance metrics to a 
previous study conducted by Ashfaq et al. in 2022. Ashfaq's research utilized three parameters (body temperature, heart rate, and oxygen 
saturation) and achieved a top performance of 96% using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN). The analysis utilized a dataset obtained from the 
MIMIC-III clinical database. Four models were evaluated: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) as part of the ML 
approach, and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as part of the DL approach. Performance 
evaluation was conducted using five measurement metrics, namely accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The findings 
demonstrate significant performance by all models, with MLP exhibiting the highest overall performance measures, including an
accuracy of 99%, precision of 99%, recall of 99%, F1-score of 98%, and ROC AUC of 98%. The RF model closely followed MLP in 
terms of performance. This research provides valuable insights for medical researchers, individuals, academies, analysts, and artificial 
intelligence enthusiasts, informing them about research ideas and areas for improvement, particularly in the health sector, specifically 
in the management of CVD in humans. Furthermore, the integration of these models into monitoring systems using body sensors could 
facilitate prompt emergency intervention for CVD patients. In comparison to the previous study by Ashfaq et al., this research expands 
the parameter set to include five body parameters, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of CVD prediction. The utilization of 
advanced ML and DL models highlights the potential for significant improvements in the field of cardiovascular disease prediction and 
management.
