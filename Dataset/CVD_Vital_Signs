This dataset comprises five human physiological or biological body symptoms that healthcare experts continuously monitor, crucial for recognizing or tracking medical disorders across various settings, including medical facilities, households, and emergency scenarios. Termed "vital" due to their significance in determining a patient's clinical status, vital signs encompass heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure, assessing fundamental bodily functions. Normal ranges, as indicated by Healthline and medical sources such as Johns Hopkins Medicine and Sapra et al., typically fall within specific parameters: heart rate - 60-100 beats per minute, respiratory rate - 12-18 breaths per minute, blood pressure - 120/80 mmHg, oxygen saturation - 95-100%, and body temperature - 98.6°F (37°C). Abnormal oxygen saturation levels below 95% at rest, as stated by Europe PMC, Khan et al., and Windisch et al., signal potential health concerns, underscoring the importance of maintaining a saturation level of 95% for optimal physiological function.
